Skin stretch is an effective way to simulate virtual textures, forces, and directional cues, but has been rarely applied to lower limbs. Our studies show that Gaiters can create rich haptic experiences during various leg movements. Participants found the feedback compelling and enjoyable for enhancing virtual reality interactions.",

Skin stretch enhances the perception of forces and directional cues but has rarely been explored as HMD output for virtual reality. Our studies confirmed that Masqueâ€™s feedback is comfortable, perceivable, and effective for enriching VR experiences. Participants found the facial haptics engaging and considered it a valuable addition to VR interactions.",
